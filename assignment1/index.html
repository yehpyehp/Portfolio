			<img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

			<p>Hi, my name is Paul Yeh. I was born and raised in Taiwan, then traveled to United States when I was 11, in the year 2000. I have stayed here 16 years to receive my education in UC Irvine and started working as a digital marketer for Age of Learning, during which time I have developed a strong interest for coding as I have many coworkers who are developers as well. I hope to achieve my goal for this class, which means making myself among good coders.</p>

			<p>Not sure what else to put here, I'm just kinda here to complete my homework, but hopefully the site will turn up well.</p>
